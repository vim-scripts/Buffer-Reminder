Attention, names of variables have changed ! 

this plugin is destine to people, which would like to save list of opened files on vim exit, and open them on vim enter. 
Tested on Win32 platform, but on Linux it's must work too. 

there is three variable which you should config: 

let g:BufferReminder_SaveOpenedFilesListBUFFER=1  (def)       - if you like buffer one variant 
let g:BufferReminder_SaveOpenedFilesListBUFFER=0                 - if you like tabs open variant 

this option work only in tabs mode:
let g:BufferReminder_removeNoNameBuffer=1    (def)            - if you hate NoName buffer, in this case it's satisfy you on 100% ! 
let g:BufferReminder_removeNoNameBuffer=0                        - in this case, we will spare NoName buffer 

let g:BufferReminder_openedFileBuffersList="pathToFileName"   - if you dont like default path of file
